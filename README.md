# CPP-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  The project was to create an object-oriented programming (OOP) application that met the given requirements, followed the given best practice for coding style, and included in-line comments so the code was organized and changes could easily be made by another person.

  The application was to be created to help high school students learn about fiscal responsibility and show users how their investments would grow over time with compound interest.

#What did you do particularly well?

  I liked the way the interface looked. I feel there wasn't a lot in the ways I could be creative with this project.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  If possible, I would make a GUI for this project. Something that would update as you replaced numbers and allow the mouse to be used. I'd clean up the code and add some header files as well.


#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  The challenging part for me at the time was creating a table that could span multiple years. Looking through the C++ library and google to narrow the library search are my go to tools.


#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  Creating a readable interface was what I took most from this project. Giving results to users is easy but giving multiple results at once could be disastrous.


#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  Following standard code practice and style and adding comments next to more difficult or confusing code should minimize the amount of time it would take to update or maintain a program.
