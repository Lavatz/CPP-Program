# CPP-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  The project was to create a object-oriented programming (OOP) application that met the given requirements, followed the given best practice for coding style, and included in-line comments so the code was organized and changes could easily be made by another person.

  The application was to be created to help highschool students about fiscal responsibility and show users how their investments would grow over time  with compound interest.

#What did you do particularly well?

  I liked the way the interface looked. I feel there wasn't a lot in the ways I could be creative with this project.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  If possible, I would make a GUI for this project. Something that would update as you replaced numbers and allow the mouse to be used. 


#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?


#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?


#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
